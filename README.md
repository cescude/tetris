# CLI Tetris!

## Building!

    make && ./tetris

## Playing!

There's keys!

* j/k ... left/right
* u/i ... rotate left/right
* n ..... hard drop

## Quitting!

* q ........ quit normally!
* Ctrl-C ... quit faster, but you'll need to type `reset` to get your cursor back
* ` ........ enable/disable ghost pieces

## Co-op-ing!

Press `d` or `f` to join the game as player 2!

* d/f ... p2 left/right
* e/r ... p2 rotate left/right
* v ..... p2 hard drop

## Noting!

* Written here and there over the course of a few days, I'm going to go
  out on a limb and say there's probably bugs!
* If you hate the control scheme, update the `#define`s in `io.h`.
